SM-Plugin-Checker
=================

Written in C#.

With this tool you can see all your plugins on all of your Team Fortress 2 Server (or Source Dedicated Server). Outdated plugins will be marked red.

- You need to write down your IP and Rcon password in the /bin/server.txt file
- Also have a look at /bin/alliedmod.txt. Here you can specify the threadid from the alliedmodders forum so that the software can check for new versions. (click on WebCache first)
